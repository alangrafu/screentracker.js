screentracker.js
================

A minimal client/server used to track the user's mouse movements.


How to use it
=============

### Server side

* npm install ws
* node server.js
* When you are done collecting data, use Ctrl+C to kill the process.

### Client side

* Include screentracker.js at the end of your HTML file.


TODO
====

* Add more gestures (e.g., click buttons)
* Being nice with existing functions already associated with events
* Support multipage navigation
* Support same user during different sessions
* Any other idea I can come up in the next weeks
